# Overview #

SyGENiA is a prototypical tool for the automatic generation of ontology parts for the purposes of testing and evaluating Semantic Web reasoners. Given an ontology (in OWL or RDF(S)) and a query, SyGENiA can generate a set of test data (instance axioms/facts/ABoxes) which together with the ontology and query can be used to test Semantic Web query answering systems. Moreover, given only an ontology, SyGENiA can also generate a set of (test) queries. These test queries can then be used to generate testing data.

The goal of SyGENiA is to enable application developers to automatically generate testing data in order to evaluate Semantic Web reasoning systems over their applications. The data and queries generated by SyGENiA are not random. For the input ontology (and query), the generated data would subject the tested system to an actual reasoning/inference test.

Finally, SyGENiA is able to combine and duplicate the generated data and create arbitrary large datasets. These datasets can be used for performance evaluation.

SyGENiA is mainly developed by [Giorgos Stoilos](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/giorgos.stoilos/). Large part of the query generation code has been developed by Martha Imprialou.
